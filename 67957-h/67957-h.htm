<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> northeast wind was very fresh that morning, and drove the seas
before it briskly; but the <i>Denver</i> went at each of them in her
bulldog fashion, and buried her white nose in them, and showered the
crests of those which were specially boisterous in glistening spray
over her forecastle. In the east the October sun was just beginning to
peep over the sea-line, while to the northward lay the great mountain
island of Madeira, already changing, by the magic touch of the light,
from a phantom grey to that living green so dear to the eyes of a
seaman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span> Soon signs of life began to appear; a village could be made
out nestling in each of the valleys which furrowed the mountain-side,
while yellow villas dotted its wooded slopes. In a bight at the south
base, white in the morning sunlight, lay the town of Funchal, in front
of which, like a huge sentinel, knee-deep, stood a towering rock
crowned with a fort, reminding one of a castle on a chess-board.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, chief boatswain’s mate of the <i>Denver</i>, and his
friend, Jimmy Legs,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the master-at-arms, sat on the weather side of
the forecastle, under the forward eight-inch turret, with the collars
of their pea-coats turned well up over their ears, taking a morning
smoke. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan had a keen eye for the beautiful, and it was his wont
on such occasions to sit in silence for as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span> much as an hour at a time.
The master-at-arms, being a ’tween-decks man, delighted in watching the
seas break over the bows, although this amusement not infrequently cost
him a wetting and a pipeful of tobacco.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> The name given to the master-at-arms aboard ship.</p>

</div>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan was a young man with reddish hair and small, expressionless
blue eyes, and his Christian name was Dennis. He had a round, full
face, abnormally so on one side because of the large piece of navy
plug which invariably distended it. I have said that he was chief
boatswain’s mate of the <i>Denver</i>, for the reason that he was so
known at the department, and drew his pay as such. But, as a matter of
fact, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan’s status, and the scope of his influence on board that
ship, would be as hard to define as the duties of the captain set forth
in the new regulations. His friend the master-at-arms consulted him
on all matters of importance; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span> junior officers of the ship never
interfered with anything he might be doing; and the seniors showed
unwonted deference to his opinions.</p>

<p>As the <i>Denver</i> drew more and more under the lee of the land the
whitecaps subsided into lateral swells, and the wind was no longer
felt. On board active preparations were being made for coming to
anchor, but with that noticeable absence of noise and bustle which is
so characteristic of a modern man-of-war. Boat crews were clearing
their boats for hoisting out, the lashings were being taken off the
gangways, and the booms were ready to drop with the anchor. The
master-at-arms shook the ashes out of his pipe, and broke the silence.</p>

<p>“I hate to see that young feller go, Dennis,” he said.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan evidently understood clearly who the young person alluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
to in this somewhat indefinite regret was, for he answered:—</p>

<p>“He’s the finest young fellow in the navy, Chimmy; you can put that
down.”</p>

<p>“I hear the navigator say,” the master-at-arms went on, “there ain’t no
doubt but what he gets his orders for home when we strikes in here.”</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan fell into reminiscence.</p>

<p>“There’s two cadet cruises I took with him,—him and <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Morgan,—and
wild cruises they was, too. There ain’t much I wouldn’t do for both
of them young fellers; they’re two of a kind, and then they ain’t.”
But before <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan could explain this apparent contradiction he
was called upon to pipe all hands to breakfast. He watched the men
reflectively as they filed below.</p>

<p>“Do you mind that English young lady as <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington was consortin’
with when we was here before, Chimmy, in the spring?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>The master-at-arms recalled her well.</p>

<p>“Mark my words, Chimmy,” said <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, impressively, as he went down
the hatch, “he’ll be takin’ her home with him.”</p>

<p>Now the master-at-arms was inclined to doubt this. He was a personal
friend of the senhora who did the cooking at the villa where the young
lady lived, and the senhora had told him a great deal about the affair
in question. How <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington and <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Morgan were in the habit of
going to the villa almost every evening, and how <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Morgan talked to
the young lady’s father on the veranda, while <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington and the
young lady spent their time in the garden below or in the summer-house;
and finally, a day or so before the ship sailed, how <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington
had asked her father a question (the character of which the senhora
could only conjecture), and then had left the villa in haste. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span> had
afterward overheard the young lady’s father express himself on the
subject of naval officers, against whom he seemed to be particularly
prejudiced. All of this the master-at-arms had confided to <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan
at the time; but nevertheless, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan had predicted trouble.</p>

<p>“He ain’t goin’ to heave to for the old one’s blessin’,” that worthy
had said contemptuously; “not if I know <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington, he ain’t. He’ll
go back and get her when he gets a chance.” At that time the people
of the <i>Denver</i> had not expected the ship to be ordered back to
Madeira.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Afternoon found <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan and the master-at-arms going ashore in a
surf-boat. They both sat in the stern, and the buttons on their new
mustering-clothes shone like bright-work. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan was more than
usually silent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span> and preoccupied, and when they arrived at the pier,
instead of having his customary argument with the boatman over the
fare, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan gave the man a dollar, greatly to the astonishment and
indignation of his side partner, the master-at-arms. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan paid no
attention whatever to his friend’s protestations, but climbed the stone
steps, and led the way up the main street to the Plaza, where he turned
into a wine-shop, and sat down at one of the tables.</p>

<p>“We’re not drinking to-day, you Dago,” he said, in response to the
smiling inquiry of the proprietor. “Porto some cigarettos!” Thus having
aired his Portuguese, and obtained the desired articles, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan
produced a roll of bills from his pocket, which he had just received
from the paymaster, and proceeded to count them over carefully.</p>

<p>“There, Chimmy,” he remarked, rolling his tobacco from one cheek to
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span> other, as he laid the pile on the table; “I don’t get full this
time, nor you don’t; what’s more, I don’t lend none of the bullies
money. But if this here seventy-three dollars can help <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington
to get that there English young lady, and take her off in the packet
to-night, he’s welcome to it; that’s all.” This was a very long speech
for <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan to make.</p>

<p>“Is he going to try it, Dennis?” asked the master-at-arms,
incredulously.</p>

<p>“Is he goin’ to try it?” <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan repeated witheringly. “Ain’t you
ashamed, what’s been three years with him, for that there remark?”</p>

<p>The master-at-arms puffed at his cigarette in silence, and evidently
felt the force of the rebuke.</p>

<p>“Yes, Chimmy,” <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan went on in a milder tone, “he is going to try
it;” and then he added, with an air of great secrecy, “He is leavin’ a
good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span> deal of the particulars to you and me.”</p>

<p>Whereupon he unfolded a plan to the master-at-arms, who could not but
wonder at its wisdom and completeness. It would almost seem as if
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan had conducted a similar elopement on his own account. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Keegan’s powers of locution were not great, but he had a remarkable
knack of conveying his meaning, the more remarkable because his face
was absolutely without expression, and he never used any gestures.
Perhaps one of the secrets of his ability to express himself lay
in the fact that he alternated in his methods of explanation, now
putting his hearers to shame at their stupidity, now leaving out a
palpable conclusion, that they might give themselves credit for unusual
perception. In any case, he never said any more than he had to.</p>

<p>“Now,” he concluded, when he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> gone into every detail, “you have got
your sailin’ orders, Chimmy. Get your friend, the senhora, to tell the
young lady what I told you. We can’t take no big trunks—nothin’ but a
small kit. I’ll be makin’ sure of a boat and a sky-pilot, and be here
at two bells.”</p>

<p>The master-at-arms went out into the Plaza, and hired a
<i>bulla-carta</i>. A bulla-carta is in reality a covered sled,
provided with curtains, and drawn by two oxen. For the proper
management of these vehicles, according to Portuguese ideas, two
men are necessary. One goes ahead, in order to check any ambitious
intentions on the part of the oxen, and apparently does the guiding.
The duties of the other are harder to define: he receives the fare
incidentally, and urges on the oxen in those plaintive, wailing tones
which he who has been to Madeira can never forget, and which incline
him to believe that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span> Portuguese language is one of lamentation. As
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan tersely remarked, everything is “on skates” in Madeira. The
streets of Funchal are paved with small lava blocks, set on end, and
polished to a degree that makes walking dangerous to people who wear
the shoes of civilisation. Hence the owners of the bulla-cartas do a
thriving business with foreigners, especially up the slope, where a
false step is fraught with no inconsiderable consequences.</p>
<p class="center p2"><span class="figcenter"  id="img005">
  <img src="images/005.jpg" class="w50"  alt="He sat back behind the curtains of his bulla-carta" />
</span></p>
<p class="center caption">“<span class="smcap">He sat back behind the curtains of his
‘bulla-carta.’</span>”</p>

<p>It was up the hillside, or rather up the first slopes of the mountain,
that the villa to which the master-at-arms was going was situated. Few
visit Madeira who do not take that delightful ride up the mountain on
horseback, and experience the delirium of the coast down, over the
polished stones, in a wicker sled. Ascending, the traveller looks
from his saddle over the high yellow walls on each hand into inviting
gardens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span> of tropical luxuriance, their shade trees often completely
arching the way over his head. But the master-at-arms cared nothing
about looking into the gardens, and had a sailor’s prejudice against
horses; he discreetly preferred the bulla-carta. Even the picturesque
procession of wine-growers which he met coming down the mountain, with
skins slung over their shoulders, made no more of an impression on him
than if they had been a draft of new hands. He sat back behind the
curtains of his bulla-carta, and smoked brown-paper cigarettes, and
meditated on the gravity of his mission; and he wondered whether the
senhora would look with favour on the plan. Only once, when he had to
turn out for a fat ecclesiastic from the convent above, was he aroused
from these reflections. The priest was descending at a pace which would
have defied a trolley-car, but sat in his sled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span> with as much equanimity
as if he were pronouncing a benediction, his guide deftly balanced on
the runners behind.</p>

<p>“He’s sure swift for a holy father!” the master-at-arms exclaimed
aloud, lifting the curtains in order to obtain a better view of the
vanishing figure; “but Dennis ain’t hirin’ him for the ceremony—you
can’t trust them Dagos even for splicin’.”</p>

<p>It was almost dusk when the master-at-arms recognised the back gate
of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield’s villa, and directed the gentleman at the side to
draw up, which he accomplished with a great deal of unnecessary noise.
Thereupon the master-at-arms alighted, and designated a point a little
higher up for the men to wait for him. Then he opened the gate, and
cautiously entered the garden. He sat down under a banana tree to hit
upon some method of attracting the senhora’s attention; for the hour
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span> unusual for a call, and the senhora was undoubtedly engaged in the
kitchen. As the villa was on a rather steep portion of the slope, the
house was considerably higher than the garden, its broad piazza being
among the tree-tops. Here was a predicament! If he waited until the
senhora finished cooking the dinner, put on her evening gown, and came
down to the little porch where she received her callers, all would be
lost. Bearing in mind the sentiments concerning his profession which
the owner of the villa had expressed at various times, it was out of
the question for him to go to the senhora, as he would undoubtedly be
seen by <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield from the veranda. While he was vainly trying to
hit upon an expedient, wishing ardently the while that <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan might
have undertaken this matter himself, he heard the rustle of a woman’s
skirts coming down the path. His first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> impulse was to climb the tree,
but on second thought he decided to sit still; it was getting dark, and
he might not be seen where he was.</p>

<p>He had barely reached this decision when there appeared in the path,
directly before him, a young girl. She was tall and fair, with that
wealth of colour peculiar to English women; and as she stood there
in the twilight, shading her eyes with her hand, the master-at-arms
was transported with admiration. From where she stood one could look
through an opening in the trees far out into the harbour, and he had
no doubt that fortune had thrown him in the way of Miss Inglefield
herself, and that she was looking at the <i>Denver</i>. He rose,
took off his cap, and coughed slightly to attract her attention. At
the sound the girl dropped her hand quickly, and turned toward him,
without, however, betraying the least alarm; her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> manner was a mixture
of surprise and self-possession. The master-at-arms was anything but
self-possessed; he was, on the contrary, very much disconcerted. Miss
Inglefield, for it was she, waited for him to speak; but at length,
despairing of this, she spoke herself:—</p>

<p>“Did you wish to see any one?”</p>

<p>The voice was softer than any the master-at-arms had ever heard, and
its tones were so kind that he took heart.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss,” he answered; “I guess it’s you I want to see.”</p>

<p>“Me?” she exclaimed, in evident wonder.</p>

<p>“I’m from the <i>Denver</i>, miss,” he explained.</p>

<p>The master-at-arms watched the girl keenly to see what effect this
announcement would have, but if her colour deepened it was too dark to
notice it.</p>

<p>“So you are from the <i>Denver</i>, and wish to see me,” she answered.
“If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span> that is the case, I think it would be well, for many reasons, to
retire to the summer-house.”</p>

<p>She picked up her white skirts, and led the way down a secluded path
lined with vines to a little arbour in the corner of the garden. The
master-at-arms followed, not without misgivings concerning his ability
to handle a mission of such delicacy as this promised to be. The
ease and dignity of her bearing, and the simplicity of her speech,
completely mystified him; he had expected any reception but this. When
they reached the summer-house, she motioned him toward a wicker bench,
and sat down beside him.</p>

<p>“I think we shall be safe from interruption here,” she said, with a
smile of encouragement; and then she added, “Did any one send you?”</p>

<p>Although the master-at-arms thought the question a trifle strange, he
could not but admit that it was pertinent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“Dennis Keegan sent me, miss,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Dennis Keegan! And you wish to see me—are you sure?”</p>

<p>There was such an evident note of disappointment in this that the
master-at-arms was more puzzled than ever. Was it possible that <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Pennington had not told her about Dennis?</p>

<p>“Dennis is the man who is actin’ for <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington, you know,
miss—sorter under his orders.”</p>

<p>But Miss Inglefield, greatly to his discomfiture, did not seem to grasp
the situation in the least.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” she demanded, with a touch of impatience.</p>

<p>“I’m the master-at-arms of the <i>Denver</i>, miss,” he answered, in a
tone of injured dignity.</p>

<p>“But the orders you speak of, what are they? I do not quite understand.”</p>

<p>What were the orders? There began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span> to dawn on the master-at-arms, from
various things he had noticed in Miss Inglefield’s conversation and
manner, a suspicion that she had had no previous intimation of the
communication he was about to impart. This was a point which had not
been touched upon by <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan. He was in a quandary. To withdraw
now might injure <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington’s honour, and, besides, make things
exceedingly unpleasant for him, the master-at-arms. But if <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan
had by any chance made a mistake, to go on would involve <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington
in a difficulty the gravity of which the master-at-arms had not
before considered. But his faith in <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, and the fear of his
displeasure, finally predominated.</p>

<p>“You see, miss,” he began, “the reason I come up here, and not Dennis,
was this: I happen to be acquainted with the seenora as does the
cookin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span> for you, and Dennis he said for me to tell this here to the
seenora, and the seenora—”</p>

<p>“Has <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington sent a note?” Miss Inglefield broke in, in despair.</p>

<p>“A note!” the master-at-arms repeated deprecatingly; “he never insulted
me or Dennis with a note yet, miss.”</p>

<p>“Please go on, then, quickly,” she said; “I may be called at any
minute.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t nothin’ to it exceptin’ this, miss,” he began, in no wise
to be hurried, however: “<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington’s time’s up on the ship to-day,
and he has bought tickets for <em>two</em>”—the master-at-arms thought
the inference a very happy one, and emphasised the numeral—“on the
steamer what leaves to-night. Then he goes to Dennis Keegan, who’s been
on many a cruise with him in’s younger days, and in many a tight place,
too, and he says, ‘Keegan, there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span> a young lady what lives up here on
the hill behind Funchal—’ ‘What you’d like to take off with you this
evenin’, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington,’ Dennis puts in, ‘but there be cert’in reasons
again’ your goin’ up and gettin’ her yourself.’ <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington looked
sorter surprised, but, Lord! miss, he ought to know there ain’t much
goin’ on what Dennis ain’t on to. ‘Well, sir,’ Dennis went on, without
givin’ him a show to speak, ‘all you got to do is to leave this here
business to me and Chimmy’—that’s me, miss,—‘and if that there young
lady ain’t ready to go with you at whatever time you say, it won’t be
our fault, sir.’”</p>

<p>The master-at-arms paused, and wiped the perspiration from his face
with his red handkerchief, watching Miss Inglefield anxiously the
while. She had sat quietly by during this recital, but he could see
that she was agitated now by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span> her breathing, which came and went
quickly, and his confidence in <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan’s judgment redoubled.
Evidently, if the young lady in the case was as much in love as
she appeared from these symptoms, the course he was taking was
most justifiable. The master-at-arms had always deemed a little
prevarication in a good cause no harm. There was, apparently, quite
a mental struggle going on within Miss Inglefield. Once or twice she
seemed about to speak, and then to change her mind. It was at this
point that a hearty masculine voice was heard calling loudly from the
garden above:—</p>

<p>“Eleanor!”</p>

<p>Miss Inglefield rose.</p>

<p>“Coming, papa,” she answered; but to the astonishment of the
master-at-arms, she did not betray the slightest alarm. She walked
slowly toward the step, her head bent downward in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span> thought; then she
suddenly drew herself up to the full height of her commanding figure,
and faced him.</p>

<p>“At what time will <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington be here?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“At half-past eleven, at the back gate, miss,” he answered, doubting if
he heard aright.</p>

<p>“Tell him I shall be ready,” she said; and before he could reply she
had vanished among the vines.</p>

<p>The master-at-arms stood looking after her for a moment, and then
made his way out of the garden, keeping a bright lookout for <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Inglefield. He found his bulla-carta, after some trouble, in front of
a stray wine-shop which was built in the wall, and into which he dived
precipitately in search of his Jehus. It is to be doubted if either
of them understood the choice maritime invectives that he heaped upon
them impartially for hiding themselves; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span> they motioned him into
the vehicle with soothing urbanity, and started for the convent above,
blissfully oblivious to the occasional mutterings from within.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at the convent, the master-at-arms proceeded, by a
judicious use of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan’s funds, to make arrangements with the
sled-owners, by which every sled was to be ready for descent at eleven
o’clock. He impressed upon them that a large party of gentlemen of
his acquaintance wished to make the descent by moonlight. One and all
promised that it should be as the senhor wished, although each had
his private doubts about the moonlight. This done, the master-at-arms
descended to Funchal, where he found <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan awaiting him in the
wine-shop, engaged in making life unbearable for the Portuguese
occupants. On the entrance of the master-at-arms he desisted abruptly
from this pastime, and drew him into a corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Chimmy, is it a go?” he asked.</p>

<p>The master-at-arms regarded him in a way that plainly signified his
approbation of such an arch-diplomatist, and then launched into a
glowing description of his share of the transaction, interspersed with
frequent reproaches for not informing him beforehand of the true state
of affairs. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan listened with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>“She ain’t goin’ to take no trunks, is she?” he inquired, with some
apprehension.</p>

<p>The master-at-arms confessed he had forgotten to caution the young lady
on this point.</p>

<p>“Women, Chimmy,” said <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, profoundly, “will never leave any
spare riggin’ behind if they ain’t made to.”</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_y.jpg" width="100" height="113" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Young</span> Ensign Pennington was reclining on the lounge in the smoking-room
of Burroughs’s Hotel, Funchal, in anything but a happy frame of mind.
His travelling-case was at his feet, and his trunks were on board the
steamer which was to leave for England that night. The other occupant
of the room, his friend and classmate Morgan, had assumed an absurdly
awkward position on the table, which he always chose in preference to a
chair, and was doing most of the talking.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing could better show the difference between the
temperaments of Pennington and Morgan than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span> their present attitudes.
Under an apparent languor, and a seeming indifference to his own
affairs and those of others, Pennington concealed qualities which
made him, young as he was, one of the most efficient officers in
the service. Morgan, on the other hand, had a continual craving
for excitement, which betrayed itself in every action. Now he was
shifting restlessly from one elbow to the other, while Pennington had
not changed his position since lighting his cigar. Their characters
dovetailed into each other with such nicety that few closer friendships
have been formed than that which existed between them. Morgan’s
impetuosity was offset by Pennington’s inertia, his frankness by
Pennington’s reserve, while they possessed in common certain qualities,
invariably found in a true seaman, which served to cement the bond.
But it was Pennington who wielded the influence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span> and his was the only
influence which had ever been known to affect Morgan. Their names had
become associated at the naval academy, where Morgan had been stroke of
the crew, of which Pennington had been captain, and since then they had
been separated but little. It had been their singular good fortune—for
the discrepancy between their standings had been great—to take the two
years’ cruise together as midshipmen, and as ensigns they had both been
ordered to the <i>Denver</i>. Now, it would seem, the time had come for
a long separation, and each felt as only young fellows who have spent
the best part of their lives under such circumstances can feel, and
found it hard to realise that it might be many years before they would
meet. But gradually Morgan approached a subject which was uppermost in
his mind as well as in Pennington’s. It had always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span> been said of Morgan
that his friends’ troubles worried him more than his own, and perhaps
the chances this particular trouble offered for something hazardous
especially appealed to him. At last he broke in, with characteristic
abruptness:—</p>

<p>“Of course it is none of my business, Jack, but when I see you go
off in this way without seeing Miss Inglefield, without even so much
as writing her a line, in spite of the fact that five months ago you
wanted to marry her, I can’t help saying something, for it isn’t much
like you. I tell you what, Jack, you may travel some, but it will be a
devilish long time before you come across another girl like her.”</p>

<p>Morgan paused, uncertain what the effect of this speech would be; for,
beyond the fact that he had asked <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield for his daughter, and
had been refused, Pennington had told him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span> nothing of the affair. Now
he only smiled a little wearily.</p>

<p>“It is no use, Dutchman,” he said, in the tone of affectionate
forbearance that he often used with his friend; “that is all past now.”</p>

<p>“Thanks to your confounded, misplaced principle!” Morgan went on a
trifle warmly. “Renouncing her for a little thing like her father’s
refusal! You might have known what he would have said before you asked
him; I could have told you that. If I cared as much for the girl as you
do, Jack, and she cared as much for me as I know she does for you, I
would take her home with me in spite of all the English in Madeira.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk nonsense, Dutchman,” said Pennington, lighting another
cigar; but Morgan noticed that his hand shook a little as he held it,
and this encouraged him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“It isn’t as if you were as I am, and only had your pay,” he
remonstrated; “or it isn’t as if you were only knocking the bottom out
of your own life,” he continued, throwing in the arguments as they came
to him. “And perhaps you do not think I know what has been the matter
with you ever since we left here in the spring; but I do, and I call
coming back here fate.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if the department had rather a large share in that,”
replied Pennington, half-heartedly. “But don’t let us worry about it,
Dutchman,” he added, very much in the way he used to quiet his friend
in the old days when they were midshipmen together. It seemed to be his
place to do the comforting, no matter whose the trouble. But now Morgan
would not be comforted. He slid off the table, and went over to the
lounge beside Pennington.</p>

<p>“Jack,” he began, with an earnestness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span> which surprised even Pennington,
who was used to his ways, “you have a perfect right to ruin your own
life if you want to, although a good many of us would hate to see you
do it; still, that is your own affair; but you haven’t any right to
ruin her life. I’ve seen more of women than you have, and there are
some who get over things of that sort. She never will.”</p>

<p>Pennington was silent. A party was coming down the veranda singing the
refrain of a hearty English melody. They seated themselves immediately
in front of the windows of the smoking-room and proceeded to light
their pipes.</p>

<p>“She used to be such a jolly girl,” said one, in answer to some
inaudible remark, “but she never goes anywhere now.”</p>

<p>Pennington and Morgan listened aimlessly, without well knowing why.
Morgan chafed at the interruption, coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span> as it did at such a serious
turn in their conversation, and it seemed to banish his last hope of
influencing his friend. The lights in the smoking-room were low, and
the broad, checkered shoulders of the speaker, whose back was turned,
were pushed into the window, his elbows resting on the sill. His Oxford
cap was tilted jauntily on one side of his head, and a pipe, as if to
complete the poise, protruded from the other. The subject thus brought
up seemed an interesting one to the whole party, for those who were
still humming the air stopped to join in the talk. It was evident that
some person was being discussed.</p>

<p>“Had she been with us to-night we shouldn’t have had such a beastly
slow time,” said another.</p>

<p>To this there was a unanimous assent.</p>

<p>“I wonder what is the reason of it all?” he continued.</p>

<p>“They say it is some chap in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span> American navy,” volunteered another,
“who was here last spring—”</p>

<p>But Pennington did not wait to hear any more. He had risen, and his
grasp on Morgan’s arm was like that of a vise.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of this, Dutchman,” he said.</p>

<p>Morgan followed him out of the room. Pennington stalked through
the corridors at a pace he found it difficult to keep up with, and
through the office, where <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Burroughs, the proprietor, was reading
the <i>London Times</i> of the week before. He glanced at the two
with the air of a man who has long since ceased trying to account for
American idiosyncrasies, and then resumed his reading. At the hotel
entrance Pennington brought up against a man who was coming in out
of the darkness; the force of the impact, and the heavy blow of the
travelling-case against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span> knees, would have been sufficient to stun
an ordinary mortal.</p>

<p>But <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan was not an ordinary mortal. He waived Pennington’s
apologies, saluted him, and then thrust his hands into his pockets with
his customary nonchalance. Both Pennington and Morgan stood regarding
him in no little surprise, and waited for him to speak. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan
rolled his tobacco from one cheek to the other, and surveyed them with
deliberation.</p>

<p>“You’re the very gentleman I’m lookin’ for, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington,” he said at
length; “but I weren’t expectin’ to run again’ you so soon.” This was
literal, if nothing else.</p>

<p>“Neither was I, Keegan, to tell the truth,” replied Pennington, smiling
in spite of himself as he picked up the travelling-case. “I was sorry
you were not on board when I left the ship,” he added, “for I wanted to
see you before I went.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan evidently thought this speech perfunctory, for he paid no
attention to it.</p>

<p>“I come up here to remind you of somethin’ you must have forgot, sir.
Have you got all your stuff aboard, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington?” he asked.</p>

<p>Pennington was puzzled. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan did not look as if he had been
drinking; but then Pennington remembered that <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan’s appearance
was never materially altered under such circumstances. He had seen him
in a state of inebriation more than once.</p>

<p>“I do not remember to have forgotten anything, Keegan,” he answered. “I
sent all my baggage out this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“How about your tickets, sir?”</p>

<p>Pennington would have resented this catechism from any other petty
officer, but from <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan somehow it did not seem an impertinence.
He had always been interested in his welfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“The agent was to have my ticket for me at ten, Keegan,” said
Pennington. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Nothing sir,” said <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, with admirable unconcern, “except the
master-at-arms and me knows of a certain lady as would like to go with
you, sir, if you cared about takin’ her.”</p>

<p>Pennington looked bewildered; but Morgan, who had been listening with
increasing astonishment, realised the purport of this intelligence at
once. He grasped <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan’s hand excitedly.</p>

<p>“Tell her <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington will take her, Keegan; of course he will.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Morgan!” said Pennington, beginning to pace the floor, while
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan spat demurely into a convenient flower-vase, and waited.
Finally Pennington faced him abruptly.</p>

<p>“Who told you this, Keegan?”</p>

<p>“The lady herself told—”</p>

<p>“What lady?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Inglefield,” said <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, in no wise abashed.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“The lady herself told the master-at-arms, sir. He went up to the
viller this evenin’ to see the seenora what does the cookin’ there, and
came acrost the young lady herself as she was takin’ the air in the
garden.”</p>

<p>Pennington resumed his pacing. There must be some mistake—certainly
<em>she</em> could not have suggested such a thing. Such is the weight
of prejudice, and such is the iron-bound custom which, even in a
nineteenth century of enlightenment, prevents a woman from speaking her
mind, that <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan’s statement was divested of all probable truth by
the idea that the proposition had come from Miss Inglefield. Pennington
could not believe it.</p>

<p>“What did Miss Inglefield say to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span> master-at-arms, Keegan?” he asked
a last.</p>

<p>“She said as all you had to do was to come up there to the back gate at
half-past eleven, sir, and she’d be ready,” <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan replied without
hesitation.</p>

<p>By this time Morgan’s patience was exhausted.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Jack,” he said. “Can’t you see you’ve got all you can
do now to get up there by half-past eleven? The girl has twice as much
sand as you have.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t start now, sir,” put in <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, “there ain’t no use
goin’ at all.”</p>

<p>“Keegan,” said Pennington,—and the coolness of his speech and the
command of his voice struck both the others as he spoke,—“I have known
you for nearly nine years now, and you are one of the best friends I
have ever had. You have pulled me out of two or three tight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span> places
when I was younger, which I am not likely to forget. In those nine
years you have never deceived me, and I do not think you capable of it;
but from what I know of Miss Inglefield I think it more than probable
that the master-at-arms has misunderstood her. I want to thank you for
this, just the same.” Then, turning to Morgan, he continued: “Can’t you
see, Dutchman, even if there is not a mistake, how impossible it would
be to do what Keegan proposes to-night? Of course I shall wait for the
next steamer now. But there are certain things to be thought of—all
very necessary in their way, and very hard to get in two hours and a
half.”</p>

<p>“<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington,” said <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, gravely, “if Chimmy has made a
mistake on this, then I’m willin’ to enlist in the marine corps
to-morrow.” This was more emphatic than any oath <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan could think
of. Then he concluded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span> with a finality which set further demur at
naught: “There won’t be no trouble about a sky-pilot; there’s one on
the ship ye’re goin’ on as says he will fix things up, and keep quiet
till he does. And about details, there ain’t one you can mention what
ain’t fixed, sir.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Morgan picked up the travelling-case, and went out, followed
by <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan and Pennington, the latter in a state of mind difficult
to describe, and one not at all within the comprehension of either
Morgan or <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan had brought up three horses, one of
which he mounted himself, while Morgan mounted another, and Pennington
mechanically got on the third. They started off at as quick a pace
as the law would permit, the runners keeping silently along by their
sides. Burroughs’s Hotel was situated on an eminence to the west
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span> town, while the Inglefield villa lay on the slopes to the
northward. The road led for some distance along the high cliffs which
skirt the harbor, where the anchor lights of the vessels twinkled and
danced. Pennington could distinguish the <i>Denver</i> by her white
sides and her uncompromising, bulky form, revealed by the electric
lights of the big black steamer hardly a stone’s throw away from
her. But his thoughts were not on the <i>Denver</i>; he was looking
at the smoke already pouring out of the pipes of the steamer; it
was time—hardly two hours. And, perhaps, then—“What nonsense!”
he exclaimed to himself, half aloud. It could not be possible that
this girl, who had refused him with such firmness only five months
ago, would even consent to such a madcap undertaking as this, much
less propose one. Still <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan seemed, as usual, to be sure of
himself, and to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span> what he was doing. That worthy headed the column,
whistling softly a rather dubious air he had picked up in a Bowery
theatre the year before. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan’s horsemanship was none of the
best; when the pace quickened to a trot he managed to keep on, however,
and comforted himself with the reflection that it was too dark for
the Dago heelers to criticise. By the time they reached the town its
narrow streets were almost deserted, and the wine-shops were beginning
to close. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan reined in his horse, and waited for the others to
come up.</p>

<p>“That there ticket agent has got to be held, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Morgan,” he said.</p>

<p>Morgan was wise enough to see the force of this, and also that they
stood a better chance of success if <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan went up with Pennington.
Although it was a bitter disappointment to him not to take a more
material part in the attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span> than “holding” the agent, he acquiesced
at once, and had ridden off before Pennington could expostulate.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” remarked <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, “we ain’t got no time to burn gettin’
up that hill.”</p>

<p>They clattered over the stones in defiance of a municipal law, and
were soon on the ascent. Except for an occasional lamp at the entrance
to a villa, it was so dark that they could scarcely make out the
high walls on each side of them. Once or twice Pennington had almost
decided to go back, but <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan pushed ahead with such diligence,
as if there could be no possible doubt of the outcome, that Pennington
kept on after him. As they passed under one of the dim lights in the
wall a sled shot by, in which Pennington made out, smoking with great
complacency, two of the <i>Denver’s</i> liberty party.</p>

<p>“You have managed this well, Keegan,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span> said Pennington, as he pulled up
beside him.</p>

<p>“Chimmy is doin’ that, sir,” <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan replied modestly; “he is
up there gettin’ ’em started.” And then he added, with a touch of
satisfaction, “Unless the old one has a roller-coaster, he ain’t got
much show this evenin’.”</p>

<p>Pennington was not in a position to express his sentiments in this
matter, but he found himself fervently hoping that <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield was
not provided with anything so fatal to his chances of success. The
master-at-arms was evidently doing his duty thoroughly, and each sled
that passed them tended more and more to convince him of the method in
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan’s madness. Pennington began to think that, after all, there
must be some foundation for his statements.</p>

<p>They urged on their horses, which by this time were fairly tired of the
rapid climbing, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan cursing the “heelers,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span> as he called them,
when they growled at the speed, and in the next breath offering them
another dollar apiece. After what seemed an age to Pennington, they
arrived opposite a recess in the wall, where <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan drew up.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Chimmy?” he called out in a stage whisper.</p>

<p>The master-at-arms emerged.</p>

<p>“How about things, Chimmy?” <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan inquired. “Is they all down?”</p>

<p>“All down but that there,” responded the master-at-arms, pointing
over his shoulder. Just at this moment it struck him that a coasting
sled accommodated but two; and how he and <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan were to escape
the clutches of the irate father-in-law elect was a point he had not
previously considered.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be——, Dennis!” he exclaimed profanely.</p>

<p>But <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, who divined his thoughts, refrained from censure. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
was quick to make a virtue out of necessity.</p>

<p>“That ain’t no matter, Chimmy,” he said consolingly; “if the old
one wastes any time tryin’ to pinch us, he’ll never get hold of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Pennington there.”</p>

<p>Pennington struck a match, and looked at his watch; it was twenty-five
minutes after eleven.</p>

<p>“It is time we were there, Keegan,” he said.</p>

<p>This was virtually an admission in <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan’s favour, and <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan
knew it. Having had a very thorough understanding of Pennington’s
character, he had appreciated the magnitude and delicacy of his
undertaking, and had handled that gentleman to perfection, as we have
seen. If he felt any exultation now he did not show it, for he only
cautioned the master-at-arms, by way of reply, to stay by the sled, and
not to trust the Dago out of his sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Pennington and <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan started up as noiselessly as they might,
keeping close to the wall. The darkness was so intense that they were
obliged to feel for the gate, and their footfalls sounded to Pennington
like gunshots in the oppressive silence. After a prolonged search, and
just as they were on the point of going back to the master-at-arms for
more accurate information, Pennington came to a break.</p>

<p>“Here it is, Keegan,” he whispered; “I can feel the hinges.”</p>

<p>They tried the latch, but the gate was locked. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan bent down to
the keyhole, and gave a low whistle; but there was no response. “I’ll
get over, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington,” he said; “give me your shoulder, sir.”</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan was soon on top of the wall, whence he slid easily down on
the other side, and Pennington could hear him trying the lock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll just reconnoitre up the yard a bit, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington,” he called
through the keyhole; “you stay there, sir.”</p>

<p>As Pennington waited outside the gate, and minute after minute slipped
by, all his misgivings returned. He began to feel like a criminal, and,
what was worse, like a fool. He might have known, he told himself, that
this was all an imagination of the master-at-arms, and he wondered that
as practical a man as <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan had been duped by it. It was a choice
business, too, for an officer in the United States Navy to be mixed
up in. What a delectable story it would make when it became known in
the service! It was not that he did not love the girl; he reflected
bitterly on Morgan’s words, and felt they were only too true. He
remembered how his heart had sunk into his boots when he had heard they
were to be ordered back to Madeira, and decided then to leave, if his
orders were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span> there, by the first steamer. And now by the well-meaning
but misguided interference of his old friend <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, aided and
abetted by Morgan and the master-at-arms, he was plunged again into
the depths of misery, and, moreover, likely to be held up to his
fellow-officers as an object of ridicule.</p>

<p>Then the things which had happened the last time he saw her began
to crowd into his mind. How distinctly he recalled them—just what
she had worn, and just what she had said! She would never marry him
without her father’s consent, and she doubted very much whether her
father would give it. She was standing beside a rose bush at the time;
he could see her now—the bush itself was only on the other side of
that gate. So he had gone into the house to find <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield, and
had left her in the garden looking after him. It was as this painful
point in his recollections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span> was reached that Pennington thought he
heard footsteps on the other side of the wall. He listened intently; it
seemed as if there was another step besides <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan’s. It must be
his imagination, he told himself. Then there came the sound of a key
turning in the lock, the gate opened, and some one came out.</p>

<p>It was not <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan.</p>

<p>“Jack!” exclaimed the person.</p>

<p>“Eleanor!” exclaimed Pennington.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan closed the door, and discreetly locked it again, putting the
key in his pocket. He remained silently contemplating the two for an
instant, for they had apparently forgotten his existence, and then he
laid his hand on Pennington’s arm.</p>

<p>“Better belay that now, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington,” he said, “and get under way.”
Here <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan was forced to get rid of a certain amount of tobacco.
“Keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span> a good full, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington, and God bless you both, sir!”</p>

<p>Pennington grasped <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan’s hand, and wrung it.</p>

<p>“Eleanor,” he said simply, “this is my old friend, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan. It will
take me a long time to tell you how much we owe to him.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that, sir,” answered <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, as he took off his cap,
and rubbed his eyes suspiciously with the sleeve of his muster jacket.
“And, miss,” he continued, by way of acknowledgment of a very graceful
speech Miss Inglefield had made him, “you’ve got the finest young
officer in the navy.”</p>

<p>“The very finest,” <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan repeated to himself, when they had gone;
“she has sure got a prize.” He sat down against the wall, and began
to feel very unhappy, so much so as to become totally careless as to
pursuit or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span> capture. It was thus his friend the master-at-arms found
him, or rather fell over him, some ten minutes afterward.</p>

<p>“Anything yet from the old one, Dennis?” he inquired.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan rose.</p>

<p>“He may get on to it now,” he said, “and he may get on to it to-morrow.
We’ll just stand by a spell, in case he gets uneasy. You boost me up,
Chimmy, till I see if there’s a light in the house.”</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan got on the wall and immediately threw himself down on his
face.</p>

<p>“There’s two of ’em comin’ this way with lanterns, Chimmy,” he
whispered, “and I think one of them’s the old one.”</p>

<p>“How long ago was this, Jennings?” said a voice which, although greatly
agitated, the master-at-arms recognised as one he had heard before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“Habout ten minutes, sir, it might ’ave been.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you call me before—at once?”</p>

<p>“Hi thought as it was Perdita and that sailor as used to come to see
her sometimes, sir.”</p>

<p>Then followed a period occupied by tentative efforts on the gate,
during which the master-at-arms was becoming decidedly nervous.</p>

<p>“Thanks to your—conjectures, Jennings, Miss Inglefield has gone off
with a—”</p>

<p>Jennings was not enlightened; his efforts on the gate had been
unremitting, and just at this critical moment it fell heavily outward.
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield rushed out, holding the lantern the height of his face,
and peered down the hill; but the master-at-arms had disappeared in the
darkness.</p>

<p>“You go up to the convent as fast as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span> you can post, Jennings,” he said;
“I shall wait for you here.”</p>

<p>Jennings departed in double time up the hill, while <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield
walked restlessly up and down. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan was anxiously considering
the possibility of there being another sled at the convent, which the
master-at-arms had overlooked, when Perdita arrived on the scene,
breathless, and trouble written in every line of her face.</p>

<p>“Ah, senhor,” she exclaimed, “the senhorita!”</p>

<p>The master of the villa grasped her by both shoulders.</p>

<p>“You knew of this, Perdita,” he said sternly.</p>

<p>“No, senhor, no; I assure you I know nothing.”</p>

<p>“Jennings tells me he saw your friend with Miss Eleanor.”</p>

<p>“I know not what you mean, senhor,” Perdita disclaimed excitedly; and
then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span> falling back for fluency on her native tongue, she poured forth
a torrent of protestations. Her efforts, however, plainly failed to
convince <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield. Apparently he entertained the same distrust of
her race as did <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, for he leaned wearily against the wall, and
motioned her to cease.</p>

<p>“That will do, Perdita,” he said, whereupon the senhora found relief in
tears.</p>

<p>The wall about <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield’s villa was so hard and uneven, and <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Keegan was becoming so cramped in his position, that he was thinking of
letting himself down on the inside when Jennings was heard returning.
He was accompanied by two or three Portuguese from the convent, but, to
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan’s great relief, was without the sled. When the circumstance
of the liberty party became known to <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield, he said a great
many things <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span> expected him to say, but he added a few remarks
about Pennington which <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan had not anticipated. Finally the
denunciation of that gentleman became so vigorous that <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan could
stand it no longer.</p>

<p>“He is a sneaking scoundrel!” declared <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield.</p>

<p>Here <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan slid down from the wall, and approached the irate but
astonished father with a somewhat rolling but easy gait. He carefully
looked him over, from force of habit perhaps, before accosting him.</p>

<p>“<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield,” he began, very much as if he were addressing a
water-butt, “I took your feelin’s into account before comin’ for’ard,
sir; but I ain’t goin’ to stand by and listen to no such things about
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington as you was givin’ vent to.”</p>
<p class="center p2"><span class="figcenter"  id="img007">
  <img src="images/007.jpg" class="w50"  alt="The Elopement" />
</span></p>
<p class="center caption"><span class="smcap">The Elopement.</span></p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield managed to recover himself sufficiently, during the
interval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span> occupied by <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan in transferring his tobacco to the
other cheek, to exclaim angrily:—</p>

<p>“Who the deuce are you, sir, and what are you doing on my wall?”</p>

<p>“I know this here come rather suddin,” <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan went on, without
taking the trouble to answer the question; “but I want to say right now
there ain’t no finer young man anywhere, and that this here business
wasn’t his fault.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t his fault!” roared <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, coolly; “it was me what fixed the thing
up. It was me what got your daughter to consent to it, and brought <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Pennington up here to get her; and if you ain’t blessin’ me for it some
day I’m a sergeant of marines.”</p>

<p>“You!” repeated <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield, in a species of stupefaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>Now it so happened that the master-at-arms, who had remained concealed
some distance down the hill, heard the commotion, and became possessed
with the idea that his friend <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan was getting into trouble. He
arrived on the scene just at this instant.</p>

<p>“Now, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield,” <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan continued, glancing around at the
faces about the lantern, “this here ain’t no place to talk private
matters; but if you’ll take the trouble to step inside with us, me and
Chimmy’ll try to give you a loocid report of this here, sir.”</p>

<p>“Come inside, by all means, if you can throw any light on this rascally
business,” said <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Inglefield, picking up the lantern, and leading the
way to the house. The others followed.</p>

<p>“Dennis,” said the master-at-arms to <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, pulling him by the
sleeve, “there ain’t no use of my goin’ in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span> there; you knows how to
handle the old one. I’ll be payin’ the seenora that little call I
missed this afternoon.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> and Mrs. Pennington, or the master-at-arms, for that matter,
never knew precisely how <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan “handled the old one” during the
half-hour he was closeted with him. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, of course, would never
tell. All he could be induced to say, when questioned on the subject by
the master-at-arms, was:—</p>

<p>“He went in like a lion and come out like a lamb, didn’t he, Chimmy?”</p>

<p>The master-at-arms admitted that he did.</p>

<p>“Well, Chimmy,” he would reply, solemnly blinking his little eyes,
“that there’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>In the service journal, which is published in New York, there appeared
the following item:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“A most interesting and novel wedding took place on Thursday, October
31, at Funchal, Madeira, on board the steamer <i>Southampton</i> of the
Union Line. Ensign John R. Pennington, U.S.N., married Miss Eleanor
Inglefield, daughter of Robert Inglefield, Esq., of Ravenside, long and
eminently connected with the British diplomatic service. The bride and
groom left immediately for England. In consequence of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Pennington’s
hurried departure, the wedding was a surprise even to his brother
officers of the <i>Denver</i>. The young couple are now at Newport,
where Ensign Pennington is stationed; and it is understood that the
bride’s father will spend the winter with them.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The report was true, for before the Denver left Funchal the Inglefield
villa was closed, and the senhora reigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span> supreme there; and <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Inglefield had gone to see his new son-in-law at Newport, and to pay
his first visit to the United States.</p>

<p>As for <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan, he now owns a large gold chain, attached to a large
gold watch, of which he is very proud, and which he wears on all
occasions. On the outside of the case is the monogram “D.K.,” very
handsomely engraved, and on the inside a mysterious inscription, the
purport of which <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Keegan has never disclosed, but which is thought
to be expressive of the everlasting gratitude of two people.</p>

<p>Nor has his friend the master-at-arms been forgotten.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap"><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr></span> WINSTON CHURCHILL, like <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Wister</span> and <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
<span class="smcap">Crawford</span>, has a deeper claim than residence and choice of
subjects give, to the name of “American author,” since New England
blood dating back on both sides to the sixteen hundreds, Southern
birth, and a training in the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis
were united in his equipment. But after only a brief service in the
navy he resigned his commission and definitely followed the leading
of his literary tastes. He was for a short period with <i>The Army
and Navy Journal</i>, during which time his first short story, “<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Keegan’s Elopement,” was published in <i>The Century Magazine</i>.
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Churchill</span> became an editor of <i>The Cosmopolitan
Magazine</i>, but left that again, to be more free for continuous
original work than the routine duties connected with a monthly
magazine permit.</p>

<p>His first book appeared in 1897,—“The Celebrity,” written in a
vein of the liveliest comedy; but even then the first of his series
of novels, which cover characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span> phases of American social
development and will when completed present a picture of national life
such as is not only unequalled, but has never been even attempted in
its breadth and entirety, was well under way.</p>

<p>Certainly “The Celebrity,” although recognized as—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“an extremely clever piece of work that is likely to be popular as it
deserves” (<i>Boston Transcript</i>), as “such a piece of inimitable
comedy in a literary way, as has not appeared for years; the
purest, keenest fun” (<i>Chicago Inter-Ocean</i>), as “a humorously
sensational novel of a rather unusual kind, decidedly original and
entertaining, one of the best pieces of construction that has appeared
in a long while ... an altogether clever and out-of-the-way sort of
book” (<i>Philadelphia Evening Telegraph</i>),</p>
</div>

<p class="p0">did not lead the critics to prophesy any such a second novel as <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
<span class="smcap">Churchill’s</span> “Richard Carvel,” which was described as—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“seldom if ever surpassed by an American romance, in breadth of
canvas, massing of dramatic effect, depth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span> of feeling, and rare
wholesomeness of spirit.”—<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“‘Richard Carvel’ is one of the most brilliant works of imagination of
the decade. It breathes the spirit of true romance in a way that is
truly fascinating.”—<i>Philadelphia Press.</i></p>

<p>“The charm of the book, which is very great, lies in the vividness
of its pictures of the life of London and the colonies in those
picturesque days when the spirit of revolution was slowly but surely
developing.”—<i>Washington Times.</i><br />
</p>
</div>


<p>Coming just a year later, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Churchill’s</span> next great novel,
“The Crisis,” dealt as effectively with the questions and scenes of
the Civil War as did the earlier story with the struggle between the
colonies and the mother country. Of the qualities which have made it
rarely valuable, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Hamilton Mabie</span> wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘The Crisis’ is distinctly the most carefully studied and the most
convincing novel which has yet been written on the Civil War; no other
story brings the reader so close to some of the great figures in the
struggle; no other brings before the imagination so distinctly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
terrible experiences which befell those who stood in the centre of the
storm. ‘The Crisis’ is a footnote to American history, as well as a
stirring and moving novel.</p>

<p>“As a study of the plain, substantial stuff of which American
citizenship is largely made up, ‘The Crisis’ has deep and abiding
interest. It ought to be read by those students of American life
beyond the sea who are anxious ‘neither to laugh nor to weep, but
to understand’; for it brings out the heroic fibre of the best
American stock, its quick responsiveness to the educational power of
opportunity, its resourcefulness, its unassuming dignity and force.”—<i>The Times Saturday Review.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“It is a high office to give a new generation of Americans their first
vivid conception of the struggle in which the nation was reborn.”—<i>Review of Reviews.</i><br />
